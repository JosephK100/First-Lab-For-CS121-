## Joseph Kloepper


## Main Goal:
Over the course of this class I'm hoping to learn more about my major and how to think more like a programmer. There's so much to learn!


## Something Interesting
I love working on arts on crafts projects during my free time. I try to push myself as an artist and lately I've been trying out new shaping and sewing techniques.
